     <div class="fade-in-text" id="secondline"><h2>There are uncountable posts on Xiaohongshu that spread a ridiculous skinny standard: a woman should not weigh over 100 lbs, body fat 14% is considered aesthetic, the drink diet which skinny girls just drink for a day's meal, the potato diet, the egg diet, pills that make your skin glow, abs photos that might be photoshoped or unrealistic.</h2></div>

          <div class="fade-in-text" id="row-2"><p>Social media showcases the best of people’s lives. It presents a carefully curated version of reality and presents it as fact. We are just naturally more likely to post when we are happy, on holiday or to share successes – and even then we choose the best version to share, but most of the times IT'S NOT REAL</p></div>
          <div class="fade-in-text" id="row-3"><p>The posts are often a perfectly curated, photoshopped, produced, filter-applied moment. It’s not a fair comparison.Remind yourself that comparing your reality with a selected moment on social media is an unrealistic benchmark. This is especially the case with high-profile accounts who are paid to create perfect content.</p></div>
